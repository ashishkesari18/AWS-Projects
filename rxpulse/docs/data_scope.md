## Data Scope & Ethics

This project uses a small, curated sample of publicly available Reddit discussions
that explicitly reference Amazon Pharmacy.

Collection principles:
- Educational and research use only
- Manual-scale, low-frequency access
- No user identifiers collected or stored
- No AI or model training on Reddit data
- Aggregated analysis only

The ingestion layer is intentionally designed to support official APIs
or internal enterprise data sources in production.
